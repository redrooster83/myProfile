									<p><b>ChatGPT</b>
										<ul>
											<li>Command Line Prompt</li>
											In December 2022 I heard about ChatGPT and immediately registered an account.  After enjoying many conversations I suddenly wasn't able to access the site.</br>
											I started looking into the possiblity of interfacing with ChatGPT through Python commands or general text commands, that would be able to carry out intelligent functions such as slicing data or creating visualisations.</br>
											Instead of finding a solution for that, I found a couple of forums that helped me put together Python built prompted interactive chat with ChatGPT.</br>
											<img src="images/chatGPT.png" alt="ChatGPT">
											<li>Data Visualisations using ChatGPT</li>
											My team uses mstrio for MicroStrategy on a regular basis for various functions, and the module comes built with various functions to interact with MicroStrategy's REST API.</br>
											I wondered if I could combine ChatGPT with mstrio, but so far I was only able to create a matplot visualisation which I still find as an interesting.</br>

									<p><b>Python</b>
										<ul>
											<li>pyautogui Automatically Move Mouse Cursor</li>
											I was asked by a client to create a Python based program that would automatically open a file in a program and perform certain keystrokes.</br>
											I started researching about pyautogui and during the course, I realised I could quickly put together a python script to automatically move my mouse cursor.</br>
											As silly as it sounds, it helps me during workouts at home to stop my screensaver kicking in, so that I can skip through songs on my Spotify.</br>
											<img src="images/pyautogui.png" alt="pyautogui">
											<li>Python cgi scripts</li>
											I had an idea one night if it was possible to utilize our existing installation of MicroStrategy to host a Python application, instead of going through the trouble of installing a Python web framework.</br>
											I came across a website indicating that it was possible to use cgi scripts hosted in the Tomcat Webapps folder, and I managed to build a cgi script webpage that uses Python to connect to the MicroStrategy API to refresh cubes through a button displayed on a webpage.</br>
											<img src="images/cgiscript_redirectmessage.png" alt="cgiscript_redirectmessage">
											<li>Python REST API</li>
											After spending some time with MicroStrategy to implment a POC using their Hypercard feature, I got very curious on how I could use the built in API feature.</br>
											Through a lot of trial and error, and many late nights I was able to get a firm understanding of how the process worked, and realised the power that REST API's can give to providing different ways to interact with data.</br>
											<img src="images/pythonapi_cuberefresh.png" alt="pythonapi_cuberefresh">
										</ul>
									<p><b>Google Charts</b></br>
										At my previous employer they had decided to move to GCP and move away from MicroStrategy, I wondered what type of BI Tools Google had available and quickly realised that there would be quite a gap.</br>
										I began researching Looker and started learning about Google Charts.</br>
										<ul>
											<li>Org Structure</li>
											I found this visualisation very helpful, and if an organisation has built their org structure correctly then it makes it really simple to create a visualisation using Google Org Structure Charts.</br>
											Something I wish I could integrate with MicroStrategy.</br>

											<li>Xampp</li>
											When I began studying web development almost 12 years ago, it was quite a hard concept to fully understand how web servers, php servers and databases all fit together.</br>
											I probably should have shopped around for a better course, but now after attempting to pick up the technology again due to updates in technology that MicroStratgy has offered, it's suprisingly easy to quickly get things up and running using Xampp.</br>
											MicroStrategy's Web and Library feature can both be deployed on Tomcat, and with their Library feature being able to work with their own REST API, it's a great opportunity to start exploring those skills using an easy to understand application.</br>
											<img src="images/xampp.png" alt="xampp">
											<li>PHP</li>
											I was working on a word document that I found quite frusting due to the multiple formatting options that had been set.  It made the document quite difficult to fill out, and I found that I spent most of my time removing lines in the document which had been placed there intended to be printed out.</br>
											I thought that I could try to solve this problem using an HTML form tag for each question that could write my answers into a database based on my profile, and once I've filled out every question, I would be able to build an analysis of each of my answers.</br>
											I hadn't looked at PHP in a very long time, so this was a great opportunity to re-learn this skill after 12 years, and it would give me the opportunity to build a relational database.  I have really enjoyed learning PHP and have gained some extra skills on the relational database development.</br>
